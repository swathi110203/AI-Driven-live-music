# AI-Driven-live-music
In real life we come across circumstances where a budget friendly concert needs to be arranged which means here we are cutting down the requirement of sound engineer and concert and let AI do its job. Accordingly the model identifies the instruments and vocals and try to analyze the environmental noise and suggest the gain in frequency.  
#Dataset 
Here we have created dataset from scratch in studios which includes guitar, drums, piano and vocals. 
#Result 
Since the dataset is very small , model at times fails to identify the instrument. In future anyone can work on dataset and make this model more accurate.
